        This function must be implemented by the model.

        Must return numpy arrays containing the time vector and the voltage values recorded on the stimulus location (soma), and a nested dictionary containing voltage vectors of the recorded dendritic locations at the examined distances in this test.

        eg.: {dist1: { ('trunk_segment1',location1): numpy.array(voltage trace),
                       ('trunk_segment2',location2): numpy.array(voltage trace)

        Parameters
        ----------
        amp : float
            amplitude of the current injection (mV)
        delay : float
            delay before the current  injection (ms)
        duration : float
            duration of the current pulse
        section_stim : str
            the name of the stimulated section (eg. "soma")
        loc_stim : float
            location on the stimulated section (eg. 0.5)
        dend_locations : list
            list of recording locations in the form:  dend_loc = (dist1, ['trunk_segment1_1',location],['trunk_segment1_2',location]), (dist2, ['trunk_segment2',location]),(dist3, ['trunk_segment3',location]), (dist4, ['trunk_segment4',location])
